    description = Studies into the effects of various visual and other stimuli on Kerbal attention spans and behaviour led to the commercialization of one of the experimental apparatus, resulting in the SDHI Strobe-O-Matic SM1000 series of warning rotator lights. This model is colored white, due to a decision by management and marketing to attempt to recoup the costs of a manufacturing error.
